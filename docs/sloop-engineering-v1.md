# Sloop engineering v1 operation

## Execution

1. Product Lead completes the requirements, criteria, risks, and out-of-scope items; only then applies `Automation Ready`.
2. Dispatcher runs `npm run sloop` manually, selects the lowest-numbered open issue, and writes local state. It never starts another active task.
3. Worker creates or updates a PR whose base is `main`; the Worker publishes `[Worker]` evidence in the PR.
4. GitHub Actions owns format, test, and build gates. The dispatcher polls the required PR checks and never executes `npm test` as a local gate.
5. QA/SDET posts a review first. Staff Reviewer posts an independent adversarial review only after QA passes. Feedback returns to a replacement or continuing Worker and increments `reviewRound`.
6. Only when CI is green and QA plus Staff are clear on the current head is `ready_for_human_merge` set. A person decides whether to merge; `main` remains protected from sloop.

## PR comment protocol

Every review round has one publication per role. Markers are mandatory and case-sensitive: `[Staff Review]`, `[QA/SDET Review]`, and `[Worker]`. Staff findings use `S1`, `S2`, etc.; QA checks/findings use `Q1`, `Q2`, etc. Review publications start with `round=<N> verdict=...` and include `commit=<head SHA>`. Worker replies preserve the ID and use `status=fixed|answered|not_fixed`. Include `file:line` for source/test references and exact commands/results in QA evidence. The dispatcher treats exit code 0 as process success, then verifies the corresponding GitHub publication; stdout or JSON alone is never review evidence.

## Recovery

A Worker run persists its `runId`, PID, lease, heartbeat, PR, branch, head SHA, phase, and review context. On startup, a missing process or expired lease transitions to `worker_recovery_pending`. The dispatcher reads the issue, existing PR, CI, comments, reviews, and saved context, then starts a new Worker against the same PR. It never deletes GitHub history or creates a second PR during recovery.

## Review-cap HITL

The dispatcher never starts a Worker beyond `maxReviewRounds`. It records `review_cap_pending` with the current SHA and outstanding QA/Staff IDs, and posts the decision context to both the issue and PR. A human may grant a local `--additional-rounds N` budget, waive exact `Q<n>`/`S<n>` findings (or all current findings), and provide a mandatory `--steer` that is included in resumed Worker, QA, and Staff prompts. A no-round waiver is only ready for human merge when all current findings are waived and CI/mergeability are healthy. Abandonment is explicit, closes the PR and issue with `wontfix`, and never merges.

## Multi-issue batches

For a batch, create `integration/<identifier>` from `main`, associate each issue in comments, and open one PR to `main`. The sequence and single-active-task rule remain in force; branches are not mixed and merges are never automatic.

## Configuration and extensions

`sloop.config.json` configures the Worker, Staff, and QA role commands, required PR check names, polling timeouts, Worker lease, review-round limit, and the Codex sandbox used by automated roles. Automated local roles default to `danger-full-access` because they must commit, push, and publish GitHub evidence; this is scoped to the configured checkout and should only be used in a trusted automation environment. `npm test`, build, and format belong in `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`, not in this configuration. State may be migrated to a remote store and commands may use API adapters in the future without changing the gating policy.
