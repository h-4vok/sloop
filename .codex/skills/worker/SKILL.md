description: Implement one claimed Sloop issue in the local checkout, open or update a PR targeting main, and leave reproducible test evidence without merging. Use for sloop work execution or manual implementation.

# worker

Work only on the claimed issue in the current checkout. Inspect the issue and `main`, make the smallest coherent change, run relevant checks, and report files, tests, and residual risk. Create or update a PR with base `main`. Entry: claimed/in_progress issue and a suitable checkout. Exit: PR plus evidence, or documented blocker. Update `worker: in_progress`, `worker: ready_for_review`, or `worker: blocked`. Do not work in parallel, alter unrelated changes, merge, or target `main`.

Before reporting `ready_for_review`, inspect the PR mergeability against `main`. If the PR is `CONFLICTING` or `DIRTY`, update the branch from `main`, resolve all conflicts, rerun relevant checks, and verify that the PR is clean/mergeable. Never publish `ready_for_review` evidence while conflicts remain; publish `blocked` evidence if they cannot be resolved safely.

Review routing: recognize only exact leading markers `[Staff Review]` and `[QA/SDET Review]` as review feedback. Worker status/evidence comments begin `[Worker]` and are never feedback. Reply in the same thread, preserving IDs (`S<n>`/`Q<n>`): `- [Worker] round=<N> ref=<S<n>|Q<n>> status=<fixed|answered|not_fixed> — <response> (file:<line> if applicable)`. State changed files/commit and verification when fixed. Resolve only fixed or answered findings; never resolve approvals or evidence. Finish with `[Worker] round=<N> status=<ready_for_review|blocked>` plus tests and residual risk. Ignore unmarked comments unless a human explicitly directs otherwise.
